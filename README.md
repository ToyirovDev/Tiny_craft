# ◼️ TINY-CRAFT 1 ◼️ 


## DESCRIPTION:
* Tiny-craft is a firstperson game created by python's ursina library. This game is similar to Minecraft, but a smaller version.
  You can build whatever you want in this game. the area is 60x60 blocks and the number of blocks you use is 10.
  By the way, the number of blocks on the ground is 1. Day and night in the game changes depending on your system clock,
  ie 6 AM to 8 PM is day and the rest is night. In addition, the game also has a cloud and a floor, if you want to add them to the game,
  uncomment cloud() and gfool() in the main code. There is a logs.txt and what you do with the blocks is saved in the logs.txt,
  but not in the game yet. So far the game has some bugs. 
  


* "The game is always will be update!"
