By the way, the number of blocks on the ground is 1.<p> Day and night in the game changes depending on your system clock, ie 6 AM to 8 PM is day and the rest is night. In addition,<p> the game also has a cloud and a floor, if you want to add them to the game, uncomment cloud() and gfool() in the main code.<p> There is a logs.txt and what you do with the blocks is saved in the logs.txt, but not in the game yet.
